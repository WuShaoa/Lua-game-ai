Learning Game AI Programming with Lua is a step-by-step tutorial approach to
learning game AI, where new systems and techniques are introduced and
implemented by the reader. 

Each script system builds upon the previous systems adding new functionality to
the AI. The AI sandbox focuses on experimentation and iteration speed to quickly
build up AI features.

If you are a game developer or a general programmer who wishes to focus on
programming systems and techniques to build your game AI without creating
low-level interfaces in a game engine, then this book is for you. Having
knowledge of C++ would come in handy to debug the entirety of the AI sandbox
and expand on the features present within the book, but it is not required.



To get started, run one of the batch script files to generate the corresponding
Visual Studio solution file.

vs2008.bat for Visual Studio 2008 SP1
vs2010.bat for Visual Studio 2010
vs2012.bat for Visual Studio 2012
vs2013.bat for Visual Studio 2013

The solution file will now be in:

build/Learning Game AI Programming.sln
